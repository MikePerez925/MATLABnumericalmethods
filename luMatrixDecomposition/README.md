#### LU Matrix Decomposition "luFactor"
Uses LU Matrix Decomopsition (facotization) to create an upper and lower triangular matrix, as well as an identity matrix.

##### Input (A)
* A = EITHER a maxtrix defined by A (A=[...]) OR the matrix itself ([...])

example: (A), where A has already been defined in the command window OR ([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])

##### Outputs [L,U,P]
* L = lower triangular matrix
* U = upper triangular matrix
* P = pivot matrix

#### Limitations
Keep in mind that input matrix needs to be square.
