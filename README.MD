## Numerical Method Algorithms
Each algorithm has a unique function as listed below.

#### Bisection Roots "bisect"
Uses the bisection bracketing method to approximate the root (zero) of a given function.


#### False Posistion Roots "False Position"
Uses the false position bracketing to approximate the root (zero) of a given function.

#### Simpson Integral "Simpson"
Uses the Simpson's 1/3 and trapezoidal rule for approximating the definite integral of either a function or tabular data.

#### LU Matrix Decomposition "luFactor"
Uses LU Matrix Decomopsition (facotization) to create an upper and lower triangular matrix, as well as an identity matrix.

#### Day Counter
Determines the days elapsed in a year based off the inputed date.
